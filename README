This is a simple program that tries to imitate Microsoft's GPO system on Linux.
It reads GPOs on a ldap server, and applies them from a directory, which is mounted however you want.

There are two modes : computer, and user. Both are pretty self-explanatory, and will be triggered by init or PAM.

Sorry, there's no "make install" rule.
To install it, you'll need to copy the generated slgm binary into /usr/local/bin. Also copy his friend, slgm_pam, which is the script that pam_exec will use.
Then add a pam_exec line in your pam chain. It should look like this :
session		optional	pam_exec.so /usr/local/bin/slgm_pam

WARNING : slgm_pam uses su to log in as the target user so it can run scripts that use ~ (it also removes the need to chmod everything you create). Because of this, slgm_pam will do an infinite loop if it is in the su chain.
In order to fix this, just remove pam_exec from the su chain (be careful if you use debian, they use a shared chain system), or remove "su -c " surrounding slgm in slgm_pam.

In the "misc" directory, you'll also find the GroupPolicyObject schema for your ldap server, and a sample initscript for archlinux. Be careful to launch boot time slgm AFTER you've mounted your network share !

SLGM outputs to syslog (and to stdout if you specify -v as the first argument), so you might want to write a syslog rule which redirects it's output into a separate file.

Have fun !
